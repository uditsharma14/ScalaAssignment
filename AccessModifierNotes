A private member is visible only inside the class or object that contains the member definition.Java would permit both accesses because it lets an outer class access private members of its inner classes.

A protected member is only accessible from subclasses of the class in which the member is defined.
In Java, the latter access would be still permitted because ‘Other’ class is in the same package as ‘Sub’ class.


Like private and protected members, it is not required to specify Public keyword for Public members. There is no explicit modifier for public members. Such members can be accessed from anywhere.
